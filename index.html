            As a death and grief companion, I provide education, support and guidance about death, dying and grief with a holistic, contemplative and dignified approach.<br>

            I walk alongside you and your loved ones through the gradual experiences of advanced aging, terminal illness and dementia to create sanctity and dignified presence through the end of life. I swim alongside you in the rough waters of sudden death, whether by accident, violence or suicide, and help you build a makeshift raft to keep you afloat. I sit with you while you find purpose and presence in what matters most to you in death and grief.<br>
            &emsp;Collaboration is central to my practice. As a holistic death care worker, I can be seen as a non-medical figure in the event of death and grief, working alongside medical professionals, care workers, family, friends and community. I am here to help you remember – since it is deep in your bones – that death is an emotional, spiritual and communal event.

        <p>
            My world is shaped by the values of love, access, justice and liberation. Too often, marginalized and oppressed people already know death and grief in intimate ways when I meet them. The heart of my death care practice wants a future where <small>ALL</small> have dignified deaths after living dignified lives. 
            <br>&emsp;
            As part of the <small>LGBTQIA+</small> community I understand the different needs that queer and trans people face in their life, care and death. I am also sensitive to the experiences of those navigating death and grief with migratory backgrounds. My clients, like myself, are part of international, activist, and arts communities.
            <br>&emsp;
            Accessibility and experiences of disability from a Disability Justice perspective are important principles for my life and work. My death care is humanistic, material, relational, sociopolitical, ecological, embodied and contemplative, with a touch of witchcraft.
            <br>&emsp;
            For the starry-eyed, my death care practice is fueled by my placement of Mars (how one takes action) in Aquarius (intellectual, creative and definitive style) in the 12th house of hidden life, secrets, sorrow and loss.

            I completed death doula training with Going with Grace in January 2021. I have been helping at a beloved local hospice since 2019. With the flow or plod of time, my-death care evolves with your-death care. 
            <br>&emsp;
            As a writer and curator with over seven years’ experience, I’m invested in the aesthetic and poetic experiences of care work and how meaning is shared through relationships. I weave these sensibilities into my death care practice with a focus on how aliveness is felt and cherished. 
            <br>&emsp;
            I am interested in and continue to learn from somatics, neuroscience, theory and philosophy, literature and poetry, herbalism, conflict resolution, non-violent communication, and contemplative and trauma-informed care.
            <br>&emsp;
            I enjoy all the pleasures of cooking and eating. I am an avid walker and qigong practitioner.
            <br>&emsp;
            I was born and raised in many corners of Florida, <small>USA</small> and lived in North Carolina, New York, and Tokyo, Japan before settling in the Netherlands.

            In this introductory session I will learn about your situation and offer ways in which we might work together. Note that I usually work one-on-one with clients, but can also provide death education through group presentations and workshops in various settings.<br>
            <br>
            <i class="light">Death companionship</i><br>
            I offer comprehensive pre-planning services to designate care wishes, caregiver support and resourcing for those serving a loved one who is dying, bedside offerings throughout the end-of-life process, and consultations to navigate the end-of-life landscape. Each and every situation is unique and I meet you and your loved ones where you are in this process. <br>
            <br>
            <i class="light">Death wellness</i><br>
            Death awareness looks different for everyone due to their embodied, social and political experience and, in any case, it transforms over time. 
            <br>&emsp;
            For those navigating death-fear and anxiety, I support you in transmuting these experiences towards compassion and connection. Opening up to death wellness means finding balance in life and death in ways that energize you to live fully and with purpose. We work together on contemplative care for engaging with impermanence, strengthening coping techniques, and processing and releasing your experiences. The goal is to gradually come to terms with reality and the potential of the present moment, including meeting pain with presence when there is no “cure.” 
            <br>&emsp;
            Death happens many times before death – think a change in relationship, a diagnosis, a sunset, a season. There are many changes throughout life which we do and do not choose. I’m here to offer contemplative care for living attentively and purposefully in alignment with your values.
        </p>

        <p>            
            <i class="light">Grief companionship*</i><br>
            Grief is as natural as tears and sweat. It’s also a process that wants to move through you, so that you can experience the fullness of your connection to who and what you love. I can help you to create practices to integrate into your days as you learn to live with loss and ways of meaningfully tending to your grief. 
        </p>

        <p class="center">*Grief companionship makes a great gift for someone in bereavement. You can schedule sessions with me for your loved one.</p>

        <!-- *** Pricing Section *** -->

        <p class="star" id="pricing">&#42;</p>
        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>
            My standard hourly rate is €80 excluding <small>VAT</small>. My services and offerings are often client-specific packages. Together we can define a container of time to work within to give clarity, structure and integrity to the process of moving through a transformative portal. For example, meeting once a month for three, six or twelve months. It is also possible to meet for one-off, one-hour sessions, scheduled as needed.
            <br>&emsp;
            I typically invoice on a monthly basis. All payments are made safely and electronically. 
            <br>&emsp;
            My death care services are for everyone, regardless of income. If you can’t afford my services, we can figure out a reduced rate or a trade, if the situation aligns.
            <br>&emsp;
            I donate 10% of my monthly holistic death care earnings to various organizations in solidarity against political and social injustices.

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>

        <p>
            My companionship and consultation often takes place over Zoom or by phone. I am able to meet in person for those who also live in The Netherlands. 
            <br>&emsp;
            English is my mother tongue. I am currently studying Dutch (A2 level at present) and continue to improve on my emotional and technical vocabulary. I have connections to a number of Dutch-English translators and sign language interpreters (<small>ASL</small>, <small>NGT</small>, and <small>IS</small>) in case these accommodations are needed. 
            <br>&emsp;
            If you are in search of a <small>PGM/BIPOC</small> death care worker or one with your specific cultural or spiritual background, get in touch and I will help you find one.
